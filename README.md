## 📋 Project Information

**Authors:** Zoya, Arvind  
**Course:** CS5610 Web Development - Northeastern University  
**Course Link:** [CS5610 Web Development](https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_online_fall_2025/)  
**Semester:** Fall 2025

## 🎯 Project Objective

JobTrack is a two-part platform that combines personal job application management with a public interview preparation hub. The application enables job seekers to:

- **Private Dashboard**: Track all job applications with company, role, status (Applied → Interview → Offer), dates, and notes
- **Public Q&A Hub**: Browse and share anonymous interview questions tagged by company and role
- **AI Mock Answers**: Generate AI-powered sample answers to practice interview responses
- **Search & Filter**: Find relevant interview questions by company, role, or keywords

This project demonstrates modern full-stack development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with JWT authentication, RESTful API design, and client-side rendering with React hooks.

## ✨ Features

### Authentication & User Management (Arvind)

- Secure user registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT-based authentication and session management
- Protected routes and API endpoints
- User profile management with update capabilities
- Change password with current password verification
- Email and username uniqueness validation

### Private Application Tracker (Arvind)

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete job applications
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor progress from "Applied" → "Interview" → "Offer" → "Rejected"
- **Rich Details**: Store company, role, submission date, application URL, and personal notes
- **User-Specific Data**: Each user sees only their own applications
- **Responsive Dashboard**: Clean table view with action buttons and modals

### Public Interview Questions Hub (Zoya)

- **Anonymous Submissions**: Share interview questions without revealing identity
- **Company & Role Tags**: Organize questions by employer and position
- **Search & Filter**: Find questions by company, role, or keyword
- **Community Knowledge Base**: Learn from real interview experiences

## 🎨 UI Palette & Design Rationale

Palette (Bootstrap dark theme via `data-bs-theme="dark"`):

- Background: `#0B0C10`; Cards/Surfaces: `#11131A`; Border: `#1F2430`
- Text: `#E7E9F3`; Muted: `#9BA0B3`
- Primary: `#6E56CF` (hover: `#5A45BA`); Accent: `#7C7AF4`
- Feedback: Success `#39D98A`, Info `#4FB7FF`, Warning `#F4C15D`, Danger `#F2555A`
- Typography: Inter (Google Fonts) as the neutral, highly legible base

Why: minimalist, Linear/Cursor-inspired dark UI that keeps contrast high for readability, uses a single indigo primary for clear calls-to-action, and pairs with Inter for a modern, unobtrusive type feel.
